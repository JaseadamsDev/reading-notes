HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the language used to create websites and web pages. HTML consists of tags or elements which are used to define the structure of the webpage like headings, paragraphs, images, and other content. The tags can also be used to create links, create forms, and add styling to the webpage. HTML is the foundation of all websites, so it's important to understand the basics if you want to have a career in web development.

There are 6 levels of headings in HTML (h1-h6).

The <sup> and <sub> elements are used for superscript and subscript respectively. Examples of appropriate uses include displaying exponents, superior lettering, and ordinal numbers.

When using the <abbr> element, the title attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term.

1. CSS can be applied to HTML documents in 3 ways: Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file

2. Inline styles should be avoided as they are difficult to maintain and do not keep with the separation of structure and presentation. Inline styles also cause code redundancy and can lead to a lot of repetition, making the code difficult to read and debug.

Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:
   h2 {
     color: black;
     padding: 5px;
   }
1. The selector is the h2 element. 
2. The CSS declarations are the color: black; and padding: 5px; 
3. The components considered properties are color and padding.



1. The data type is a String.

2. The 4 types of JavaScript operators are Assignment Operators, Arithmetic Operators, Comparison Operators, Logical Operators, Bitwise Operators, String Operators, and Other Operators.

3. A real-world problem you could solve with a Function is calculating the average of multiple numbers. You could write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the average of all the numbers in the array.

1. An if statement checks a condition and if it evaluates to true, then the code block will execute. 
2. The use of an else if is to add multiple conditions to an if statement, where if the first condition is false, then the else if condition will be tested. 
3. The 3 different types of comparison operators are Equal to (==), Not Equal to (!=), Greater than (>), Less than (<), Greater than or equal to (>=), and Less than or equal to (<=). 
4. The difference between the logical operator && and || is that && requires both conditions to be true, while || requires either one of the conditions to be true.
