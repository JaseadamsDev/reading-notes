# Class 01 reading assignment.


Markdown is a simple formatting syntax that allows you to easily write rich text content for the web. 
It's easy to learn and use, so even beginners can get started quickly, which makes it easier for readers to understand and navigate your content.  
Markdown provides an easy way for writers to format their content in a concise yet comprehensive manner while still keeping everything legible. 
Markdown is easy to use and you can even make blog posts, and web pages, and share your projects. 


Notes: Markdown includes features like headers, footers, lists, tables, links (including internal and external ones), and images.
