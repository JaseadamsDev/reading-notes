# Structure web pages with HTML

## What is wireframing?

wireframing isn’t the first step in this process. First you should carrying out analysis of similar product lines to your own, digging into prevailing UX trends and best practises, and, of course, reviewing your own internal design guidelines.

Three online wireframing tools we find particularly good.

Notes: Add detail in the way you would naturally process a screen, or the page of a book: from top-to-bottom and left-to-right. 

you’re outlining and representing features and formats, not illustrating in mighty fine detail. At first don’t think about aesthetics, don’t think about colors. Your wireframe is just the skeleton of your site.
Think about the following: 
1. Usability conventions, such as putting the navigation at the top next to your logo, having a search box on the top right, and so on
2. Simple, instructional wording for i.e. calls-to-action

3. Trust-building elements: What do you need to build trust in your customers and where would be the best place to put these elements?
4. Tooltips to indicate any functionality that could be included in a prototype transition.

**Start turning your wireframes into prototypes.**
Once you’ve documented and acted upon the feedback from your first prototype, you can start developing your high-fidelity prototypes.

*summarize by reviewing three key principles to keep in mind when you’re producing your wireframe.*

1. Clarity
Your wireframe needs to answer the questions of what that site page is, what the user can do there, and if it satisfies their needs. Your wireframe is an aid for you to visualize the layout of your site page and ensure that the user’s most important questions are answered and goals are achievable without being distracted by more aesthetic considerations.

2. Confidence
Ease of navigation through your site and clear calls-to-action increase user confidence in your brand. If your site page is unpredictable, or has buttons or boxes in unexpected places user confidence diminishes. A lot of this information can already be organized at the wireframing stage. Using familiar navigational processes and placing buttons in commonly-used and intuitive positions, user confidence will soar–and that’s before you’ve even gotten around to thinking about colors and styles.

3. Simplicity is key
Too much information, copy, or links, can be distracting to the user and will have a detrimental affect on your users’ ability to achieve their goals. You want your users to be able to find their way through your site with as little extra ‘fluff’ as possible, to the elements that map to their most significant goals in a given context.

Your wireframe should be a visual guide to the framework of your site and how it will be navigated. Attractiveness at this stage is not a consideration. Once you’ve decided who your product or service is for, you can begin laying out the information they are looking for in an intuitive and natural way that is not only familiar to them as users of this kind of service, but that also guides them towards the conversion point or otherwise helps them to achieve their goals in the interaction. By presenting your information in this way, you are aligning both the business goals of your site with the needs of the customer.
