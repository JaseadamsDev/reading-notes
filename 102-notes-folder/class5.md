CSS

What is CSS? Why do we use it? How?

Cascading Style Sheets

You can write it 3 ways:
1. External Separate CSS file connected to HTML
2. Internal CSS is built into the html file
Inline CSS is built into the HTML element itself

Class & ID selectors ways to "grab" (select) the HTML elements


Selector {property: value;}

selector { 
    property: value;
}

What is CSS?

1. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a set of rules that help you create websites that look great.

2. With CSS, you can control the look and style of your website. This makes your website look nicer and more professional.

3. CSS is a language that tells websites how to look and feel. This means specifying things like the design of a site's pages, the way they are styled, and how they are arranged on the screen.

4 CSS can be used to change the way a website looks without changing the code itself. This means that CSS can be used to style different parts of a website separately, or even on different pages.



1. A document is a file that is made up of text in markup language.

2. HTML is the most common markup language used for documents. Other common languages include SVG and XML.

CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with the main content area and a sidebar for related information.



CSS syntax


1. CSS is a language that defines the rules for how your web page looks. You do this by specifying which styles should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements.

2. CSS lets you control the look and feel of your web page in a way that is easy to understand and use.

Example: You can decide to have the main heading on your page to be shown as large red text. The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:

h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 5em;
}

In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector. This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case, we are styling level one headings (<h1>).
We specify the property (color in the above example) before the colon, and we specify the value of the property after the colon (red in this example).

This example contains two declarations, one for color and the other for font-size. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting (<h1> in this case), then a value that we'd like to give the property.

User styles, UA styles (default Browser)
Note: A browser is sometimes called a user agent, which basically means a computer program that represents a person inside a computer system. 

/* IDs are for specific unique elements */
/* Classes are for multiple elements */
