Read: 07 - Programming with JavaScript

# My reading notes for Class 6

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the extremely frequent structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

if (isEmpty(field)) {
  promptUser();
} else {
  submitForm();
}
the above excerpt might be inside a function that runs when the user clicks the Submit button for the form. The function could also include a loop, which iterates through all of the fields in the form, checking each one in turn. 

A typical script in JavaScript or PHP (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.
