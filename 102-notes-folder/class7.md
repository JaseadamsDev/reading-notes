# What is Javascript?

Javascript is a scripting language that helps websites run more quickly and efficiently. It enables developers to create dynamic pages that are easy to update, modify, and add new content. Additionally, Javascript allows for cross-platform compatibility so webpages can be accessed by users from different devices (phones, computers, etc.).

It helps to make websites more interactive and user-friendly, as well as faster and easier to develop. Additionally, it can be used for developing desktop applications or even hardware devices.
Javascript is widely accepted across the web development community since it offers many conveniences such as stand-alone scripts, object-oriented design patterns, destructuring assignments and introspective functions.

- Javascript is a programming language that is used for creating interactive websites and web applications.

- It helps in making web pages more responsive and user-friendly.
- It is easy to learn and has a wide range of applications.
- Some common uses of Javascript include: creating user interfaces, managing data, and performing server-side scripting.
- It is one of the most widely used languages in the world.

Control flow

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

1. Code is read from top to bottom, and then from left to right.

2. If you see any structures that change the flow of control (like conditionals and loops), the computer will run the code from the first line in the file to the last line.

3. The script will submit validated data if the user fills in all of the required fields.

4. If the user leaves a required field empty, the script will prompt them to fill it in.

To do this, the script uses a conditional structure or if...else, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not:

if (isEmpty(field)) {
  promptUser();
} else {
  submitForm();
}

1. JavaScript and other programming languages include control structures, like conditionals, loops, and functions. These structures are put in to make the code easier to read and understand.

2. When a part of the script is executed, it often depends on certain conditions being met. This is done by using control structures.

1. Control flow is the way a script is written and it includes looking at how the different parts of the script work together.

2. When reading a script, you need to make sure that you understand how everything is connected and what will happen as a result.



For example, the above excerpt might be inside a function that runs when the user clicks the Submit button for the form. The function could also include a loop, which iterates through all of the fields in the form, checking each one in turn. Looking back at the code in the if and else sections, the lines promptUser and submitForm could also be called for other functions in the script. As you can see, control structures can dictate complex flows of processing even with only a few lines of code.
